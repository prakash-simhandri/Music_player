# Music_player
In this project, I made a simple Music player using <b>python2</b> and I have used pygame library Extremely basic testing of the mixer module. Load a sound and play it. All from the command shell, no graphics only playing the song one by one and when will song playing that time show the different types emoji on terminal.

## The Requirements
### Pygame
~ you need to instal Pygame. Pygame is a cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games. It includes computer graphics and sound libraries designed to be used with the Python programming language.

## Installation process
```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install python-pygame
```
If it not work then follow next command
```
$ sudo apt install libsdl2-dev libfreetype6-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libportmidi-dev
```

If you are using Linux based OS, open your terminal and navigate to the directory where `M_player.py`,`emoji_json.py` files is located. Now, you can run the game by using the following command.

```
python M_player.py
```
# Happy coding :)
